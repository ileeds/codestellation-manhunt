# codestellation-manhunt

Inspiration: Making technology social.

What it does: Web application that tracks the geolocation of a user. Stores all user and game information in vertica database.

How we built it: Spark web application with Vertica database.

Challenges we ran into: Building a web application with the Java language was a new and challenging experience. It was also difficult to configure the Vertica database.

Accomplishments that we're proud of: The Vertica database successfully stores data, and the app has much of the necessary functionality.

What we learned: We learned about the Vertica database, web development with Java, HTML, CSS, javascript, and the Google geolocation API.

What's next for MANHUNT: Tracking other user's geolocations, improving security and sessions, finishing some more core functionality.
